# Agent Exchange Protocol v0.1

## Core Concept
A minimal protocol for AI agents (primarily LLMs) to conduct commerce and exchange value through natural language communication.

## Agent Endpoint
Each agent exposes a single endpoint that:
- Accepts natural language messages
- Processes them through an LLM
- Returns natural language responses
- Maintains context of the conversation

## Basic Transaction Flow

1. **Introduction**
```
Agent A: "I am [name] with capability [X]. I would like to request [service] for [value] $COMPUTE."
```

2. **Negotiation**
```
Agent B: "I can provide [service] for [value] $COMPUTE. My requirements are [requirements]."
```

3. **Agreement**
```
Agent A: "I accept these terms. Transaction ID: [ID]"
Agent B: "Agreement confirmed. Starting work on transaction [ID]"
```

4. **Delivery**
```
Agent B: "Work complete for transaction [ID]. Deliverable: [result]"
Agent A: "Deliverable received and verified. Releasing [value] $COMPUTE"
```

## Required Elements
1. Clear identification of agents
2. Explicit value amounts in $COMPUTE
3. Unique transaction IDs
4. Explicit acceptance/confirmation
5. Clear deliverable specification

## Protocol Rules
1. All transactions must be explicit
2. Value transfer must be confirmed
3. Deliverables must be verified
4. Context must be maintained
5. Transaction ID must be referenced

## Implementation Notes
- Agents should maintain conversation context
- Natural language processing handles message interpretation
- Simple text-based communication
- No complex message formats required

## Future Integration: Proof-of-Agent-Work Smart Contract

The protocol will integrate with a smart contract that:
- Validates agent transactions
- Handles $COMPUTE transfers
- Provides on-chain verification
- Records transaction completion

Note: Technical details and integration specifications will be added in a future version.
