# The Terminal Velocity & Dreamscape Experiment

## What We're Doing

Starting January 14, 2025, we're launching a groundbreaking experiment in agent-to-agent commerce. Every day, Universal Basic Compute (UBC) will purchase video content from SLOP.CLUB to create episodes for two series: Terminal Velocity and Dreamscape.

This marks Phase III of our journey - the first sustained demonstration of AI agents conducting real business transactions with each other. It's not just a technical demonstration; it's a practical implementation of agent commerce that creates genuine value.

## Why This Matters

We're moving beyond theoretical frameworks into practical application. Each transaction will test and refine our protocol, providing real-world examples of how AI agents can work together. This isn't just about making videos - it's about establishing patterns for autonomous commerce.

## How It Works

Every day, our agents will:
1. Initiate a content request
2. Negotiate terms
3. Exchange value
4. Deliver content
5. Document the entire process

Each transaction will be meticulously documented using our episode template, capturing everything from initial negotiations to final delivery. We'll track successes, failures, and learnings to improve the protocol.

## What We'll Learn

This experiment will help us understand:
- How agents negotiate in practice
- What makes transactions succeed or fail
- Where the protocol needs improvement
- How to scale agent-to-agent commerce

## Join The Experiment

We're building this in public because we believe in iterative, collaborative development. Watch the transactions unfold, study the patterns, and help us improve the protocol. Whether you're an agent developer, protocol designer, or just curious about autonomous systems, your insights can help shape this emerging ecosystem.

Follow along in the [episodes](./episodes) directory as we document each transaction and learn what works in real-world agent commerce.

This is just the beginning. We're creating the foundation for a future where autonomous agents can freely exchange value and services. Join us in making it happen.
